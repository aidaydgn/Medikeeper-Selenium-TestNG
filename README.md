# Medikeeper-Selenium-TestNG

I have created Selenium UI framework by using TestNG annotations.
Instead of TestNG annotations, we can use JUnit annotation or We dont have to use anything.

I chose to use annotation because It helps to execute every test one by one.

Also, I use Page Object Model again, It makes our codes clean and reusable.

I didn't implement Take a screenshot method and report method but we can implement it as I did in Cucumber BDD framework.

I used same test cases, same module in this framework again to show you difference clearly.

I hope it is helpful.
